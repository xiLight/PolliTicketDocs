# Requirements

:::info

Please note that you need a **[Discord Account](https://discord.com/)** and a Discord server with **ADMINISTRATOR** permissions.

:::

## Discord Auth

We use the Discord Auth as login, which means that only one registration at **[Discord](https://discord.com/)** is necessary,
to be able to login.

## JavaScript

It is necessary that JavaScript is allowed, to be able to use all features correctly.

## Permissions

To view transcripts, only a login and the appropriate link are required.

However, if you want to see an overview of your transcripts and edit settings on the bot, 
then a Discord server is absolutely necessary where the bot is on and where you have administrator permissions.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this part? **[Please report it!](https://github.com/xiLight/PolliTicketDocs/issues/new/choose)**
