# Basics

Here you will find all basic information

## Where can I find the settings for the bot?

After you have successfully logged in with your Discord account, you will find the Settings item in the navigation on the left under
User-Area.

## Select your Discord server

If you have not yet selected a Discord, you must select your Discord once here.

Your Discord is not available in the Discord selection? Check your Discord permissions and make sure the bot is on Discord.

## Select the setup you want to change

There are different setups that you can edit here.

On the picture you will find 2 setups, one is the Setup General, 
which is always present as soon as you have invited the Discord, and Setup-1, 
which only exists as soon as you have finished /setup.

`A` Is only for general settings
`B` Is for setup based settings
