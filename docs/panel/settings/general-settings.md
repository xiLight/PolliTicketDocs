# General Settings

Here you will find a few explanations of the general settings

## Guild Name

If you ever change your Discord name, it would make sense to change the name here as well, since the guild name is not changed by us.

## Guild Owner

If you change the owner on the Discord server, you can enter the new owner here.

:::info
It is important that the owner is logged in, because only the owner can change General Settings.
